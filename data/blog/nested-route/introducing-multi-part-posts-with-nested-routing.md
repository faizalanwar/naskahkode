# Nested Routes

The blog template supports posts in nested sub-folders. This helps in organisation and can be used to group posts of similar content e.g. a multi-part series. This post is itself an example of a nested route! It's located in the `/data/blog/nested-route` folder.

## How

Simplify create multiple folders inside the main `/data/blog` folder and add your `.md`/`.mdx` files to them. You can even create something like `/data/blog/nested-route/deeply-nested-route/my-post.md`
